 1. error.c - Exception class needs to be set up right to be extendable and throwable from userland (with a gerror underneath)
              this will require some very fancy wiggling.
 1. error.c   Also need to add constructor and tostring methods to the class

Need to have /generate directory with spec files and run generator on this yet, once generator is usable
